## Pins Required to support given number of LEDs

From Wikipedia

If the number of LEDs is known, then the previous equation can be worked backwards to determine the number of pins required:

| Pins | LEDs |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1      0    |
| 2    | 2    |
| 3	   | 6    |
| 4	   | 12   |
| 5	   | 20   |
| 6	   | 30   |
| 7	   | 42   |
| 8	   | 56   |
| 9	   | 72   |
| 10   | 90   |
| 20   | 380  |
| 40   | 1560 |
| n	   | n2 âˆ’ n |
